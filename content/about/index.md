### Hi, I'm Connor Brewster. I'm a recent Computer Engineering graduate.
### In my free time I enjoy software development.

Check out my open source projects on my 
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/cbrewster). I primarily work with Rust and
Elixir theses days, but I've had experience working with many other languages
in the past.

I used to frequently contribute to the [Servo project](https://servo.org) and 
in the summer of 2019 I interned at Mozilla and worked on Firefox graphics.
I implemented in the `backdrop-filter` property in Firefox for the WebRender
graphics backend. WebRender is a GPU-accelerated renderer for Servo and Firefox
that is written in Rust.

This blog is generated by [brewblog](https://github.com/cbrewster/brewblog), a 
static site generator that I wrote.
