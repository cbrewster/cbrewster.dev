### Hi, I'm Connor Brewster. I am a recent Computer Engineering graduate. In my free time I enjoy software development.

Check out my open source projects on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cbrewster).

I am known for programming in Rust and working on Mozilla project. I used to frequently contribute to the [Servo project](https://servo.org) and last summer I interned at Mozilla and worked on Firefox graphics. I implemented in the `backdrop-filter` property in Firefox, although it only works when WebRender is enabled.

This blog is generated by [brewblog](https://github.com/cbrewster/brewblog), a static site generator that I wrote. It doesn't do too many fancy things, but it meets my needs and was fun to create.
